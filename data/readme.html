<p>
This directory contains several datasets of compressed "bricks" of floats.  
Each file represents a single atmospheric variable for one timestep.  The file 
naming convention is <b>VAR</b>f<b>NN</b>.bin.gz, where <b>VAR</b> is the variable name (CLOUD, PRECIP, etc.), and <b>NN</b> is the timestep (1 per hour).
<p>
There is also and single 2D file (HGTdata.bin.gz) containing the height field 
of the surface topography.
<p>
The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is developed by NCAR and its 
partners <a href=http://wrf-model.org>(http://wrf-model.org)</a>, and the simulation of Hurricane Isabel and 
data processing are performed by Wei Wang, Cindy Bruyere, and Bill Kuo of 
Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Division, NCAR, and the SCD visualization 
group.

<h4>File Compression</h4>
Each file is a compressed (gzip) brick of floats.  Each file will expand to 100000000 bytes when uncompressed.  The byte order is Big Endian.

<h4>Variable Dimensions for each file</h4>
<ul>
<li>XDIM (horizontal longitude) = 500
<li>YDIM (horizontal latitude) = 500
<li>ZDIM (vertical) = 100 equally spaced levels
<li>TDIM (time) = 1 for each file with a total of 48 timesteps for each variable.
</ul>

<p>
The height data file (HGTdata.bin), contains a 2D file of floats with dimensions
500x500x1.

<h4>Array ordering</h4>

The data can be accessed as follows:
<p>
<pre>
   fread((float *) data, TDIM*ZDIM*XDIM*YDIM*sizeof(float),1, fp);
</pre>
<p>
Where XDIM=YDIM=500, ZDIM=100, TDIM=1, and fp is a FILE pointer (fopen) to the input dataset.
<p>
A single element that has an index of x,y,z, and t, is accessed as:
<pre> 
      data[x + y*XDIM + z*XDIM*YDIM + t*XDIM*YDIM*ZDIM];
</pre> 
Note: If you are reading a file with a single timestep, t=0.  Alternatively, 
you can concatenate (using the Unix cat command) several timesteps together, and
access the data with the above formula where 0<=t<=Number_of_timesteps-1.
 
 
<h4>Data Coordinates</h4>
<h4></h4>

The coordinates for the data are:
<pre>
   x (Longitude) coordinate runs from 83 W to 62 W (approx)
   y (Latitude) coordinate runs from 23.7 N to 41.7 N (approx)
   z (Vertical) coordinate runs from .035 KM to 19.835 KM (100 equally spaced levels with delta=.2 KM)
</pre>

<h4>Missing Values</h4>
Land values, where there is no valid atmospheric data, are designated with the value of 1.0e35.

<p>
Note: All of the 'Q' variables represent moisture in the atmosphere in one form 
or another.  For example, rain water differs from cloud water in terms of 
their particle sizes.  Rain water has larger drop sizes so they can fall 
through the air, while cloud water has smaller drop sizes so they stay in 
the air.  Rain water differs from snow and graupel in terms of their densities,
and so does cloud water from cloud ice.
